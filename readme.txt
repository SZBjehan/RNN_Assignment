# Run the test in a batch

$ python autograder/hw_rnn_unittest.py


# Test individual sections of your code by running the following command from the top-level directory:

$ python autograder/hw_rnn_unittest.py <test_name>

The test name can be rnn, gru, ctc, search based on which section you are testing.

e.g., 
$ python autograder/hw_rnn_unittest.py rnn
$ python autograder/hw_rnn_unittest.py gru
$ python autograder/hw_rnn_unittest.py ctc
$ python autograder/hw_rnn_unittest.py search
